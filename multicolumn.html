<p>The Problem: People of all ages need to experience socialization and leisure with others in ways that match their schedules, mood, energy and interests because it positively impacts their quality of life and bonding/relationships.</p>

<p>The Solution: An app that helps users find leisure activities. It includes a leisure generator for activity ideas. Users can buy kits for their activities or explore other interests.The app also offers mini-games to play with friends or challenging others users on Pastime.</p>

         <p>Steps to completion: Research, Ideation, Prototyping and Design.The original desire to create a project such as this was figuring how to bond various individuals.
     I went through four various research methods such as user interviews, Fly-on-the-wall observation, unmoderated diary,
     and a survey on individual's gaming habits and physical creations.I was able to gain enough insight. </p>
